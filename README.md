# ✅ To-Do List

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to add tasks with due dates, view them in a list, and delete tasks when they're done.
The data is stored in a JavaScript array and dynamically displayed on the page using DOM manipulation.
It was created to practice working with input fields, button events, and real-time list updates using JavaScript.
While it doesn’t store data permanently (like in localStorage or a database), it provides a solid foundation for managing and organizing daily tasks in a browser environment.
